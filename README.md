# Bingogg/slugify

> Converts a string into a slug. 
> Port from simon/slugify

Developed by [Pavlo Harashchenko](https://p-h-h.com) in Tallinn, Europe with the help of 
[cocur/slugify](https://github.com/cocur/slugify).
[simov/slugify](https://github.com/simov/slugify).

## Features

-   Port package simov/slugify to php
-   Provides custom replacements.
-   No external dependencies.
-   PSR-4 compatible.
-   Compatible with PHP >= 7.
-   Integrations for [Laravel](http://laravel.com)

## Installation

You can install Slugify through [Composer](https://getcomposer.org):

```shell
composer require bingogg14/slugify
```

Slugify requires the Multibyte String extension from PHP. Typically you can use the configure option `--enable-mbstring` while compiling PHP. More information can be found in the [PHP documentation](http://php.net/manual/en/mbstring.installation.php).

Further steps may be needed for [integrations](#integrations).

## Usage

Generate a slug:

```php
use Bingogg\Slugify\Slugify;

$slugify = new Slugify();
echo $slugify->slugify("Hello World!"); // hello-world
```

You can also change the separator used by `Slugify`:

```php
echo $slugify->slugify("Hello World!", "_"); // hello_world
```

The library also contains `Bingogg\Slugify\SlugifyInterface`. Use this interface whenever you need to type hint an
instance of `Slugify`.

## Integrations

### Laravel

Slugify also provides a service provider to integrate into Laravel (versions 4.1 and later).

In your Laravel project's `app/config/app.php` file, add the service provider into the "providers" array:

```php
'providers' => array(
    "Bingogg\Slugify\Bridge\Laravel\SlugifyServiceProvider",
)
```

And add the facade into the "aliases" array:

```php
'aliases' => array(
    "Slugify" => "Bingogg\Slugify\Bridge\Laravel\SlugifyFacade",
)
```

You can then use the `Slugify::slugify()` method in your controllers:

```php
$url = Slugify::slugify("welcome to the homepage");
```

After that you can retrieve the `Bingogg\Slugify\Slugify` service (or the `slugify` alias) and generate a slug.
